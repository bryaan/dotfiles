But this no longer seems to be an issue


Problem: when running nix-shell  takes the current PATH of fish shell and appends its stuff to the end.
then it runs thru the pathfile which resets everything.


Question: why is it different for bash? at least the append to path part at first?
ah bc we dont load this path in bashrc.  note if do add this in bashrc we may have the same prob
ok solution is to use a blank rcfile or equiv.
TODO verify this is the case so we know whether to get used to the long command or can just use nix-shell

Option 0:
Verify this is neccessary.  Explicitly explain use cases.
Bc i think we will only be running things like gulp and jupyter-start
and npm run dev and gin run and such.  Which means no interaction with the
shell beyond that intial command.  So I think

Option 1:
detect and remove the first part of the path.  Could use
/sbin as the end marker and assert the next entry starts with /nix/store/
then set this as the foremost path entry and can proceed with rest in this:

Option 2:
We seperated all the shell scripts into their own modules.
We only need certain modules per dev env. For dotfiles we would need:
nothing really?

What follows is the purpose of
nix-shell --command 'env HOME=/tmp/foo fish'
